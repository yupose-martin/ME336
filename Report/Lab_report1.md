# **2** ***\*Assignment part\****

In this section of the laboratory experiment, it is necessary to integrate the various function codes developed in the previous phases and write new code as per the job's specifications to fulfill the given requirements of the task. This part of the experiment requires not only the successful execution of the code and obtaining results but also designing the experiment and analyzing the outcomes. It is crucial to carefully plan and execute the experiment to ensure accurate and reliable results. Therefore, attention should be given to both the technical aspects of the code and the experimental design to achieve the desired objectives of the experiment.
